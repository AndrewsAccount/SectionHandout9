Section Handout #9: Objects and Data structures


You cannot compare strings using "==", you must use ".equals()". 
The "==" operator compares the addresses of reference objects.


In the second set of code, you're pulling a single char out of the string. That char is a primitive 
	data type. So now you can use "==" to compare the primitive data type to the character 'Q'.
You will be checking to make sure the name is only one character long and that it equals the 'Q'.
If it meets those conditions, it will return true.
